# News-Classification

This project is about the classification of subjects in the News. 
For the first time, I have used just MLP. In this case, accuracy was low and processing took a long time.
So, I decided to add an autoencoder to my model. In this case, I saw increasing in results, the accuracy has been improved, and the time of processing decreased.
In this project, the Autoencoder has been used for reduction in dimension, and the MLP has been used for the classification.
